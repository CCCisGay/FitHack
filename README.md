# FitHack
Fit Hack is a new client in development by a 15 year old who is stupid and knows no shit about coding :)
This is goona be a long process.
No shit but I literally know nothing.

Forge 1.12.2- For Fit hack only


Basically, You put the jar file in your mods, then go to installions in your minecraft laucher, then you press edit and scroll down and then edit JVM arguments and at the end of the code you put -noverify with 1 space then you load mc and then there you go, Its future client (Fithack) cuz fit uses future only and hes very gay. Look I don't make the script I just listen to it.
